3. Small screenshot of the game in development
4. Insert art of my OC and update text on right
5. Mini chibi artwork of OC beside specific category of the heading an animate it to wiggle every 5 frames



# Goal/Brainstorm
Create page to display my portfolio of education, projects, skills, About Me, and art

It will just be a single page and you can see everything just by scrolling down

I want to use a drop down menu on the top right as a way to skip to sections instead of having a permanent header in the way of things. I think some sections might require its own page so like art so deal with this later.

I could also have a dedicated Games section later but dont know where to put it

Scaffold of what the website might look like [here](https://www.figma.com/board/efyMloz2dygVGB7CYdJpNZ/Personal-Website?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=E5KB9fY22bN09vh6-0)
## Illustrations
I want to display all the artwork I have ever done from my twitter page [here](https://x.com/LyNLinLing)
Possibly have it just on display and scrolling from left to right
I want my own OC to represent myself to act as a 'mascot'

In the future, I could make it have different sections based of the year I drew them in

## Games
1. ProjectIrene

## About Me
This will have 2 sections, one where Its me with my pen name and another with my actual name
1. Name (Real name then my penname [davadakus/LynLinLing])
2. 3 Titles to describe me
- Undergraduate (Maybe keep this to education section)
- Unity Game Developer
- Artist?
- Software Developer
3. Have a webhook that shows all my tweets?
4. Other relevant links I want to show

--
## Education
1. Institution I studied
2. How Long
3. Details like WAM

## Skills
1. Languages
2. Tools
3. Frontend Related skills (TailWindCSS, React)
4. Backend Related Skills (Python, PosgreSQL, MySQL)
--

## Projects
1. ANT Hackathon 
2. Gamebased Learning

If possible show videos and images of such




## Blog
For each upcoming and future projects since the deployment of this website, I want a section to show off my blogs for each project. Ex. ProjectIrene

To do this, probably have a seperate site that redirects to a blog post section from the main home page. This will look a bit more robust and straighforward.
The details of this will be brainstormed later when I have a clearer way of how I will display my blogs like per project, dates, etc.
