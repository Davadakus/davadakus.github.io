# Goal
Create page to display my portfolio of education, projects, skills, About Me, and art

It will just be a single page and you can see everything just by scrolling down

I want to use a drop down menu on the top right as a way to skip to sections instead of having a permanent header in the way of things

## About Me
1. Name (Real name then my penname [davadakus/LynLinLing])
2. 3 Titles to describe me
- Undergraduate (Maybe keep this to education section)
- Unity Game Developer
- Artist?
- Software Developer
3. Have a webhook that shows all my tweets?
4. Other relevant links I want to show

## Education
1. Institution I studied
2. How Long
3. Details like WAM

## Projects
1. ProjectIrene
2. ANT Hackathon 
3. Gamebased Learning

If possible show videos and images of such

## Skills
1. Languages
2. Tools
3. Frontend Related skills (TailWindCSS, React)
4. Backend Related Skills (Python, PosgreSQL, MySQL)

## Illustrations
I want to display all the artwork I have ever done from my twitter page [here](https://x.com/LyNLinLing)
Possibly have it just on display and scrolling from left to right
I want my own OC to represent myself to act as a 'mascot'

In the future, I could make it have different sections based of the year I drew them in

## Blog
For each upcoming and future projects since the deployment of this website, I want a section to show off my blogs for each project. Ex. ProjectIrene

To do this, probably have a seperate site that redirects to a blog post section from the main home page. This will look a bit more robust and straighforward.
The details of this will be brainstormed later when I have a clearer way of how I will display my blogs like per project, dates, etc.
